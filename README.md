# Currencies exchange assignment

I did the assignment using simple react + vite setup.
Prioritized speed so added minimum amount of libraries. Only those that were necessary.
Committed gradually as I go. Should pretty easy to understand what I was doing here.

## On styling

Even though it was not necessary I wanted to add shadcn-ui and tailwind/css and use some of the builded dropdowns.
I had problems with node, tried to downgrade to older version but still had problems in initializing.
Didn't want to spend to much time on it as I really wanted to finish in 2 hours so it is pretty fair with others.
I used custom Dropdown which I found in one of my testing projects. Hope that's ok.
useDebounce hook is also from my test project, hope that's fine too.

## Run

To run you just need:

npm install
npm run dev

But you need to also have env with the variable: VITE_API_KEY
Please get the key from the website or if you want to use mine I will attach it in the email.
